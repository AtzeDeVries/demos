## Python-typing

Tired of those runtime type errors when developing in python? Mypy, together with type hints, allows you to perform static type checking on your python code. 

### Demo Content

[Here](https://github.com/coopnorge/demos/tree/main/week23/python-typing) you can find plenty of examples under the `tests` folder and a configuration file to play with `mypy.ini`.  Tests include examples on generics too, so make sure to check it out!
